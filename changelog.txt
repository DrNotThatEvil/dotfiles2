Version 2.1
Added a official changelog so i can keep track of the stuff i do in my dot files witch is pretty good
i'm currently reworking my dotfiles and my laptop since i find it to slightly inificient and you know us nerds
we hate slightly inefficient stuff and want to replace it by mildly better improvments.
These mildly better improvements will once become something quite significant and one day and i will be faster
then i ever was using windows.
LONG LIVE midly better improvements!..


Changes: 
-- Removed all packages to start from scratch
-- Moved to new branch so if my old setup does crash while writing this version i can still install it.
-- Added OhMyZ and zsh to the system

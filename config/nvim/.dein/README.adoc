== Intro

This plugin provides a single command that deletes the current buffer in a
smart way.

Basically you don't have to think in terms of `:bdelete`, `:close`, `:quit`
etc. anymore, since the plugin does that for you.

It reduces cognitive load and lets you focus on the main task: editing text.

    :Sayonara

This deletes the current buffer and closes the current window.

    :Sayonara!

This deletes the current buffer and preserves the current window.

== Installation and Documentation

If you don't have a plugin manager, I suggest having a look at
link:https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug.git[vim-plug]. Installation is a
breeze afterwards:

    Plug 'mhinz/vim-sayonara', { 'on': 'Sayonara' }

Restart Vim or `:source $MYVIMRC`, then do `:PlugInstall`.

TIP: Read `:h sayonara` for more information about this plugin.

== Details

First of all, `:Sayonara` or `:Sayonara!` will only delete the buffer, if it
isn't shown in any other window. Otherwise `:bdelete` would close these windows
as well. Therefore both commands always only affect the current window. This is
what the user expects and much easier to reason about.

If the buffer contains unsaved changes, you'll be prompted on what to do.

*Sayonara:*
```
  * mark current buffer
  * current window is the only window in current tabpage?
    true  => is there only one tabpage?
             true  => are there any other active buffers?
                      true  => switch to most recently used active buffer
                      false => Is g:sayonara_confirm_quit set?
                               true  => confirm whether to quit Vim
                               false => quit Vim
             false => close tabpage
    false => close window
  * delete marked buffer unless it is shown in any other window
```

*Sayonara!:*

```
  * mark current buffer
  * are there any other active buffers?
    true  => switch to most recently used active buffer
    false => create an empty scratch buffer
  * delete marked buffer unless it is shown in any other window
```

NOTE: If a window with an associated location-list is closed, the location list
will be closed as well.

== Isn't this the same as bufkill?

No.

The biggest difference is that bufkill doesn't handle other windows and
tabpages at all, so if you try to delete a buffer that is also shown in another
window, multiple windows will be closed. Sayonara is more predictable in this
regard, and, if at all, only closes the current window.

Bufkill also doesn't handle associated location lists.

Sayonara simply handles more corner cases and tries to make one command always
Do The Right Thing whereas bufkill provides multiple commands so you always
have to think about what you're trying to do.

Sayonara's code is much shorter and simpler than bufkill's.
